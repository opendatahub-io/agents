# ODH Agents Experimental Repository

## Purpose

Welcome! This repository is a sandbox for the OpenDataHub community to conduct experimental work on agentic reasoning. Think of it as a digital workshop or a lab notebook. Our primary goal here is to explore, prototype, and test new ideas in the rapidly evolving field of AI agents.
